I"c<p>Goals are beautiful dreams. There are thousands of books dedicated to providing you compelling lessons and advice on goals and the ways to go about attaining them. There isn't a problem in those books, at least not more than the problem in the readers themselves. People read them, try to enforce them in their lives and only a handful succeed. One of the problems I see is how people overlook themselves in the pursuit of their goals. So, my attempt here is to simply make people rethink about the role their personality plays in goal orientation, which is your motivation towards achieving your goals.</p>
