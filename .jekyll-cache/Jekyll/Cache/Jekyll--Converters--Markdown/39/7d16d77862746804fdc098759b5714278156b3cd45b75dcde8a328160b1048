I"Ì<p>Trekking has always been my panacea. It breathes new life into a seemingly alive but a dying soul. After a mundane year of existence, I needed it more so than ever as keeping my sanity at bay in the tumultuous yet lonely streets of Kathmandu is something I have always found extremely challenging. The occasional help comes from my departure into the creations of the natural world. The alienating life of the city quickly becomes a distant memory as I submit myself physically and emotionally to the vivid experiences offered by the natural world. In essence I consider this experience to be religious and if channeled wisely, opens limitless possibilities for answers to questions of existence and meaning.</p>
