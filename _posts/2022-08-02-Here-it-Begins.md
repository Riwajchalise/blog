On November 12 2020, I got this blog set up, and almost 2 years later, I am writing my first blog. What took me so long? Perfection.

I wanted my site to be perfect, I selected a platform to blog, chose a theme, set up a newsletter, got a domain, tweaked the design, configured analytics, ranked my site on google too, and did almost everything except the main thing BLOGGING.

Someone once said, "If you wait for perfect condition, you will never get anything done." and rightly so, I have realized by waiting for the situation to be perfect for me to start writing. To me, perfection is a glorified excuse.

Today with this post I vow to write at least one post every week, I will not wait for the perfect situation to knock on my door. Instead, I will make consistency my new mantra. I have heard consistency makes thing perfect along the way, there is only one way to know that, try it.
