The infamous philosopher Heraclitus had said &quot;Change is the only constant in life&quot;. This is something we can all intuitively relate to through our personal experiences. Although we strive for a life that constitutes a permanent state of happiness, we live a life that constitutes as many, or even more, painful moments, as pleasurable ones. Failed relationships, unsuccessful professional attempts, departure of loved ones are the sort of experiences that have the power to overwhelm even the strongest of souls and minds. However, latent within these experiences is the capacity to grow and connect ourselves with the power that lies untouched within us. Yoga helps individuals unite themselves with their inner strength to discover new spirit and tranquility in life. Practicing yoga has become an inseparable part of life for millions of people around the world who pursue discipline of the mind and body to accomplish a balanced lifestyle. Yoga empowers mind and soul by helping a person practice mindfulness, overcome negative emotions, improve concentration, prevent mental illness and secrete more positive brain hormones. Practicing yoga can significantly improve an individual&#39;s mental health and elevate soul to new heights.

Practice of yoga can enable a person to become more mindful of his/her surrounding. To be mindful means to concentrate one&#39;s awareness on the present moment. Our senses perform the task of imparting information from the surrounding onto the brain. But we can only be aware of our sensory perception by being attentive at the very moment we are experiencing it. The practice of yoga in itself is a mindful exercise. When we immerse into the present moment by coordinating our breath and motion, we become mindful. Being mindful, in turn, improves the quality of our experiences, regulates emotions and provides control over our cognitive processes.

Yoga can help an individual regulate his/her emotions. By allowing one to channel stress and tension to one&#39;s advantage, yoga exercises can significantly help a person avoid chronic pain and displeasure, while at the same time create a cocoon of tranquility in life. According to an article published by Harvard University, yoga practitioners have higher pain tolerance and lower pain-related brain activity. This means that people who practice yoga have higher degree of emotional resilience in the face of an adversity.

Yoga improves the concentration of our brain. With smart phones and social media at our disposal throughout the day, completing a task with utmost concentration has become very difficult. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has increased at unprecedented level in past decade and this has significantly affected people&#39;s ability to focus on their already endless tasks. People have, for thousands of years, resorted to yoga to improve their concentration level and become more productive in what they do. Dharana, translated as practice of concentration, trains the mind to become more clear and focused on one thing at a time. Various meditative and physical exercises of yoga are centered on removing distractions, helping a brain focus, and remembering and performing better.

Yoga has proven effective in treatment of various mental disorders such as schizophrenia, insomnia, ADHD, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Inclination for self-treatment and perceived higher efficiency have encouraged people to prefer yoga over medication to overcome mental health issue (Jorm et al., 2000). Taking pills sounds easy and effective, but in many occasions side effects of taking pills have degraded people&#39;s physical and mental health. Yoga, on the other hand, although time consuming, has proven itself to be effective as well as free of any serious side effects on physical and mental well-being. Thus, yoga can be used in treatment of various mental health issues without posing any harm.

Yoga can trigger secretion of positive brain hormones like dopamine, gamma-amino butyric acid, oxytocin, and serotonin, which are responsible for making a person happier and optimistic. Simultaneously with the increase in positive brain chemicals, cortisol, a hormone linked with stress and fear, also decreases. So, yoga not only elevates a person&#39;s soul by making him/her happier but also reduces the possibility of stress and fear in life.

The benefits that people can expect by committing themselves to yoga in everyday life are endless. Some of these benefits include improved mindfulness, emotional well-being, concentration and mental health, and secretion of positive brain hormones. By helping individuals connect with their inner strength, yoga has the power to develop a strong mind and a soothing soul, allowing them to better cope up with whatever life throws at them.
