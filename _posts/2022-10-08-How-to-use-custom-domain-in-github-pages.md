Github pages is an awesome tool to host your static website. In this post we are going to see how we can deploy our static html site into our github pages. This article assumes that the site is alredy pushed into you public gihub repositary.

We will be using following tools:-
- Github
- Cloudflare

Make sure the repo where you are pushing your code is a public. If not **go to your repositary > click settings > scroll buttom to danger section > click the change repository visiblity buttom > click make public.**
